<!-- This will insert the data in the hello.greet into the body of the h1 element. Notice how the {{ }} are not necessary around the expression inside the ng-bind attribute. -->



<!-- One has an ng-show directive and the other has an ng-hide directive. Both directives look at the myData.showIt boolean variable to determine if they should show or hide the span element. The ng-show directive will show the element if the model value is true, and hide the element if the model value is false. The ng-hide directive will do the opposite: Hide the span element if the model value is true, and show it if the model value is false.

Notice how the controller function sets the myData.showIt to true. This means that the example above will show the first span element and hide the second.
 -->
<!-- The HTML elements (span elements in this case) are hidden using the CSS property display: none;. That means, that the HTML elements are still present in the DOM. They are just not visible. -->
